▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/noorfathima7799/hangman-game.git


Open the project folder.

Open index.html in any modern web browser.

Click once on the page and start typing letters on your keyboard.

🧠 How the Game Works

A random word is selected at the start.
Player guesses letters using the keyboard.
Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.

Wrong guesses:
Reduce coins
Draw parts of the hangman figure
The timer tracks how long the player takes.

The game ends when:
The word is guessed correctly (Win)
Maximum wrong guesses are reached (Loss)
Coins reach zero

📌 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
Handling keyboard events in JavaScript
Managing game state (timer, score, streaks)
Controlling timers using setInterval and clearInterval
Implementing dynamic UI updates
Using Git and GitHub for version control

✨ Future Enhancements

🏆 Leaderboard / high-score tracking
💾 Save best time and streak using localStorage
📱 Mobile-first UI improvements
🎁 Hint system using coins
